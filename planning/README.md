# Planning Phase Prompts

This folder contains prompts to help you plan and structure your project before you start coding. These prompts are perfect for the early stages of development when you're defining requirements, architecture, and technical decisions.

##  Available Prompts

### Product Requirements
- **[PRD Questionnaire](./prd-questionnaire.md)** - Interactive questions to build a comprehensive PRD
- **[PRD from Idea](./prd-from-idea.md)** - Generate a complete PRD from a rough concept  
- **[PRD Refactoring](./prd-refactor-existing.md)** - Improve existing requirements documents

### Technical Planning
- **[Architecture Design](./architecture-design.md)** - Design system architecture and technical approach
- **[Tech Stack Selection](./tech-stack-selection.md)** - Choose the right technologies for your project

### User-Centered Planning
- **[User Stories](./user-stories.md)** - Convert requirements into actionable user stories

##  When to Use Planning Prompts

### Starting a New Project
1. Use **PRD Questionnaire** if you need help structuring your ideas
2. Use **Tech Stack Selection** to choose your technologies
3. Use **Architecture Design** to plan your technical approach
4. Use **User Stories** to break down features into actionable tasks

### Improving Existing Projects
1. Use **PRD Refactoring** to improve existing documentation
2. Use **Architecture Design** when adding major new features
3. Use **User Stories** to better define unclear requirements

##  Pro Tips

- **Start with PRD**: Always begin with clear requirements before making technical decisions
- **Involve stakeholders**: Use the questionnaire prompts in meetings to gather input
- **Iterate**: Planning is iterative - use these prompts multiple times as your understanding evolves
- **Document decisions**: Save the AI responses as project documentation

##  Planning Workflow

A typical planning workflow using these prompts:

1. **Requirements** → Use PRD prompts to define what you're building
2. **Users** → Use User Stories to understand user needs
3. **Technology** → Use Tech Stack Selection for technical choices  
4. **Architecture** → Use Architecture Design to plan implementation

##  Next Steps

After completing planning:
- Move to [Development Phase](../development/) prompts for implementation
- Use [Testing Phase](../testing/) prompts to plan your testing strategy
- Reference [Documentation Phase](../documentation/) for project documentation
